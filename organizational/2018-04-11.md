## Meeting discussion

DN:
what do we need from club? what do we need to grow club?
scientific computing / computer literacy skills
skills that can help you land a data science career

TH:
for growth
- needs to be a driving force e.g. Virus club organizer that actually asks "why didn't you show up? what can we do better?"
- need to have meetings / events / topics planned out in months in advance if possible
- every meeting shouldn't be a bunch of lectures
- I like the hands on stuff: bringing laptops, working on getting stuff working
- then advanced students can say I've been helping for 2 years

VS:
should we pitch it as a coding class? (should this club be more focused on that)
problem with broad strokes coding class is that you get people w/diff levels of proficiency, it's hard to tailor a class
If we focused on a class w/a target audience we could eliminate some of those issues

DN:
class would be one part of plan for data science program that emory will eventually have--this is based on what faculty are planning (with my input ... and yours--please let me know what you think about these things) as they apply for a grant that would support data science curriculum development
TAs for class would have taken the class previously
this class would then prepare students for a projects-based course
students with promising projects from the course would then be eligible for e.g. travel funding to present at conferences

DN:
aside -- other things I am learning from interviews
we need familiarity with big O notation, algorithms and data structures stuff
we need to gather resources
we need a way to get experience with data we didn't generate

EM:
these are things we should ask recruiter to discuss when we talk with him:
what are the things PhD students have to learn to be ready for data science careers

DN:
so again, what do we what want from an organization? (attempts to summarize last bit)

TH: (doing better job of summarizing)
computing literacy in science
career development for people that want to go in that direction
people that want the careers can help with the computer literacy

VS:
we don't have the #s right now to put together organization

EM:
once we submit charter request, how much of a lag time is there?
between submitting and getting the budget

TH:
The name should still be inclusive of the club should still be inclusive!

VS:
I'm still hung up on the class, a general coding class
I would prefer a full-length course
TH:
with you guys teaching it?
DN:
concerns from faculty about having it be a full course
for now while we're still trying to build interest and recruit people I think it's best to have bootcamps/short courses/workshops
VS:
there's no enforcement/incentive to complete a short course/bootcamp though

TH:
to get people on board
plan for some sort of bootcamp
make it focused so people have one skill every time they leave

EM:
do a bootcamp **before** school starts
can we make it so that there's some end product

TH:
have one case study so they're used to the data, don't have to adjust to a new data set every time

DN:
it's not just having an end product, the end product is a start to building your portfolio: having a presence on Github showing that you can use version control, work with data, etc.

TH:
Yes focus on these kind of things for the club--bootcamps, workshops, hands-on project development
as far as things as bringing in alumni, Bug Robin Harpack more

for club meetings
have it focused more on projects
so that newbies see why we care about this stuff 
and pick up the lingo
give it video access, so people can log in
make one of them on-line montly webinar
you have to have two people manning the event--Zoom is kind of awesome

DN: so plan is...
do all the things,
focus on short bootcamp for just before August
let's have software carpentry
https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/
then have a longer "short course" during fall semester
that prepares people for a hackathon in spring
also have monthly meetings but go back to project based
EM:
plan for trajectory throughout the year
so that you keep using it
e.g. we went to a hack-a-thon
we'll do it so it builds throughout the year
hackathon is "capstone"

TH:
have short course be 7-8 weeks
record the courses
post material on Canvas
it would be smart to use structural design software

also have:
calendar of events
alumni mixer

EM:
have things planned in advance
so people see you can learn throughout the year

Atlantic article journal club meeting
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/
get it out this week so everyone knows
graduation is the 14th
couple journal club with people that are going to talk
these people are gonna talk about these things
Monday April 30th meeting
Alex   -- Binder?

EM:
what about doing a hackathon
that would be the thing to work towards

TH:
talk with CS about sponsors?
they probably have connections with companies already

EM:
talk with QTM

buy people lunch
ask people to RSVP

EM:
talk with public health about sponsors too, since they also run a hackathon

## discussion after
DN (to SA): what would you like to see in meetings that would get you to attend

SA: do more things that involve everyone, not just Python (R) users
examples include:
ways to optimize your code so that it runs faster
parallel processing
data pre-processing
talk about translating from one language to another -- e.g. from Matlab to Python
Would be interested in being TA for course with lab session

DN: good points, also can talk about things like Jupyter, Jupyterlab, and how they let you be more language agnostic, by using for example Matlab in the same notebook as Python, that way you can focus on tools

-------------------

KR: in TJ Murphy stats course now, strongly feels a lab component is needed with focus on writing code and implementing the statistical concepts described in lecture
Suggests a dry run of any course, possibly with high school students / undergrads?
Would be interested in being TA for course with lab session

SP: ECDS might be a good resource for course design?
