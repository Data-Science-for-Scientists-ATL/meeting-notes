## start to plan software carpentry bootcamp
* which sessions?
  Intro to Programming w/Python, Intro to git, intro to command line
  look at what other places do in e.g. 2 day sessions

* some random ideas I have for methods clinics
  + neural nets: Jim Kwon vocalizations, Sena vole orientation, other people's uses?, get help from BMI people that do this stuff all the time
  + Rett + Signe -- MARTA project progress
  + Me: how to make a personal blog / project web page easily with Python, Pelican, and github

* We should take inspiration from http://www.thehackerwithin.org
  - we should figure out how not to lose initiative / become inactive like some THW sites

  * guy that I met at SDSC and forgot to follow up with, does distributed data storage
- hackathon?
